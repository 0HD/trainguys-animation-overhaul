## FAQ

- What versions of the game will this mod support?
> For right now, the mod is being worked on in 1.19.3. Once I figure out better methods of version control for handling multiple versions, I would like to make the mod available on 1.18.2+. Depends on whether or not I run into 1.19+ specific entity model changes which may set 1.19 as the floor version.
- Will the mod come to forge?
> Yes, for the time being the mod is being developed on Fabric but the mod will eventually be moved back to an architectury project. Using a blank Fabric template for the time being while I get back into the swing of modding
- What will the mod require as a dependency?
> Right now, just Fabric API. Once Pollen is updated to 1.19, the project will be reformatted to an architectury project which will add Pollen as a dependency, for things like registries and custom block renderers.
